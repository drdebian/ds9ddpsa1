Situation & Problem
========================================================

Marketing departments are constantly challenged to improve their return on marketing investment (ROMI). There usually is no shortage on creative ideas that aim to increase sales with new campaigns, designs, target groups, etc.

As a result, marketing departments are faced with an increasing number of new things to try out. Then there is the risk that the new stuff just does not perform as well as the current versions of the marketing materials.

Questions
========================================================

- Is it possible to calculate which portions of a given set of campaign addressees should be used as normal recipients, test and/or control group?
- How can the risk of losing revenue by testing with too many recipients be balanced with not getting significant results by testing with too few?
- How can the size of the control group be calculated so that loss of revenue is balanced with the ability to calculate marketing lift?
- How can overall statistical significance be ensured?


Answer
========================================================

Use the Marketing campaign a/b test calculator to plan your empirical testing scenarios with ease: http://bit.ly/1VcdG4K

Features:

- Takes the total number of recipients, the desired test and control group size as well as the desired confidence interval and acceptable error as easy to enter inputs
- Draws a nice pie chart which directly allows the segmentation into normal recipients, test version recipients and non-contacted control group
- Makes applying the formula $n\geq\frac{N}{1+\frac{(N-1)*\epsilon^{2}}{z^{2}*P*Q}}$ (with P and Q being fixed at 50%) easy
